# MyRosterManagement
MyRosterManagement is a programme designed for SME's (Small and Medium Enterprises) to aid them in staff and roster management. The main purpose the software serves is to allow managers/shift supervisors to schedule and set up shifts for employees at certain times on certain days. It is designed to aid managers/shift supervisors in not only the planning and scheduling of shifts of the company's workforce, but will also allow them to create/edit/delete roles and employees too, should circumstances for the companies change.  
Another purpose the programme will serve is to easily view the different days and months of the year, and allow managers to visualise how the workforce is scheduled on certain days and weeks. From this, managers can then tactically decide if they require more/less staff. While able to be used for any SME, it is expected to be especially useful to SMEs which incorporate and heavily rely on shift work, such as bars, restauraunts, supermarkets, shops, cafes, warehouses and courier services.

# Wireframes
Before starting development on MyRosterManagement, Balsamiq was used to form wireframes for each separate page within the programme. Basamiq was chosen due to it's efficiency and it's ability to reproduce relatively simplistic, yet easy to understand wireframes. This helped me to visualise ideas for each of the programmes pages and features, and organise how certain features would be laid out and implemented within the programme. Each wireframe created prior to development can be seen below:

# Entity Relationship Diagram
Before starting development on MyRosterManagement, diagrams.net/draw.io was used to form an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the programme. As the programme relies heavily on models and databases, an ERD helped immensely in determining how to structure the database, including aiding in aspects such as relationships between tables, primary and foreign keys, and selecting fields for various tables. The ERD can be seen below:
